#js/browser [js.info](https://javascript.info/basic-dom-node-properties)
- ["] an extensive list of properties are listed [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp); highlights will be placed here.

- **elem.innerHTML**: allows you to edit the content inside an element. this will embed any type of HTML tags you give it. Appending content to an element is usually done with this.
- **elem.outerHTML**: basically innerHTML but the tag itself is also present. writing to this will replace the whole element (idk what taht means and idc)
- **elem.textContent**: is used to access the text-only content in an element (e.g. p, h1, etc.). writing content via this way also prevents html tags.
